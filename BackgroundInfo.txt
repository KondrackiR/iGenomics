	Prior to the aligning and analyzing of DNA strands, these samples of DNA must be sequenced using a bench-top sequencing apparatus. This type of machine requires special preparation for the DNA to be read in. The DNA must first be extracted from the cells of the sample biological substance/organism and split into smaller random pieces using sound waves at a specific frequency. These newly split strands of DNA are color-coded in a specific manner so that the sequencing machines can read in the DNA and categorize each base-pair as an A, C, G, or T. Once all of the DNA has been read in by the sequencing device, the DNA data, called reads, is saved in a file on the connected computer or server network. This file solely consists of the raw read data, the quality of each read, and the name of each read. 
	The DNA sequencing device provides no way to align the reads to a reference genome, so that is done on a computer or linked set of servers. The software used for the aligning requires both a reads file and and a reference genome (the DNA sequence the reads will aligned to) file. The DNA analyzing takes place and an export file containing alignment data and mutation information is generated. Until iGenomics, there has been no mobile version of any of this alignment software.
