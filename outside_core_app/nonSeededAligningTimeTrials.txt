1) Exact-Match Short Sequences and at the Matched Positions Compute ED of Read to the
Reference Genome
    -) Test: 20-mer short seqs
    --) 20-mers
        1) 23.519413 
        2) 23.618626
        3) 23.608485
        4) 23.640793
        5) 23.637501
    --) Unofficially Tested 15-mer short seqs: Slower than 20-mers
    --) Unofficially Tested 30-mer short seqs: Not significantly faster than
    20-mers (Only about .1 to .15 seconds faster)

2) Banded Edit Distance Computation As Opposed to the Traditional Computation
    -) Test:
    --)
        1)
        2)
        3)
        4)
        5)

3) Compute the Edit Distance for the series of length n longer Sequences to the Left and Right of the
Exact Matched Short Sequence, and generate the final edit distance of the alignment based off those edit
distances 
    -)Test: 100-mer longer sequences
    --) 100-mers
        1)
        2)
        3)
        4)
        5)
