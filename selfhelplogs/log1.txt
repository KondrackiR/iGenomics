The problem with the long real reads is that they in certain cases extend over both the
beginning of a given segment and over the end of that segment.

-My current code only accounts for one end of the segment
-Central question: If a read extends over both ends of the segment, which
segment is the read actually in?????????

Assuming the read is in the segment that it spans the entirety of, I will need
to trim both beginning and the end. This is about to be really fun.

Result: Recursion was involved. I think it works. Now each segment has high
amounts of coverage and steeper drop offs along the ends. Aligning is slower
leading me to the next question, one that I must ask Mike, should I only check
if reads over extend both sides if the reads are above a constant minimum
  length? Or possibly only if seeding is set to off?

  Imagine if there was an apocalypse and only this log remained. That would
  suck for the world
