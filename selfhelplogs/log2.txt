Banding, Banding, Banding. That's what we gotta do. 

n = EDIT DISTANCE

ED TABLE EX: n = 4

That diagram helps a lot right. Let's look for a pattern
n = 3
X X X
X X X X
X X X X X
  X X X X X 
    X X X X X
      X X X X X
        X X X X X
n = 2
X X
X X X
  X X X
    X X X
      X X X
        X X X

1) Compute the edit distance of the first n boxes. NR = Next Row.
2) NR. Compute edit distance of first n + 1 boxes
3) Repeat step 2 for the first n rows, incrementing the number of boxes each
time
4) Create a variable called startColumn = 1
5) For every row after the first n rows, starting at startColumn, compute the
edit distance of the first n boxes. After the boxes in a row are computed,
startColumn++


_--_-____----
I attempted an implementation of this algorithm. There is definitely a bug
that most likely has to do with a possible -1 or lack of -1 surrounding
numOfBoxesToComputeFor ---- THAT IS EASILY THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THE BUG

At present, following what I said above, the code contained between the
"Attempting Banding" comments does not work and the code contained between the
"New stuff" comments does work
